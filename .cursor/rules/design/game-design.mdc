# Game Design

## Project Vision
A text-based ASCII game and productivity tool for Mac that combines real-life task tracking with village building and character progression. The game uses local AI (Ollama with DeepSeek-r1:7b) for dynamic NPC interactions and story generation.

## Core Gameplay Requirements

1. Task System:
   - Mixed approach: self-reporting + time tracking
   - Categories: chores, cleaning, cooking, learning, exercises
   - Tasks integrated naturally into story and quests
   - Real-world activities reflect in-game progress

2. Progression System:
   - Long-term gameplay focus
   - Realistic development timelines
   - RuneScape-like skill progression mixed with RPG elements
   - Skills tied to real activities (e.g., exercise improves stamina)
   - Equipment/items earned through task completion

3. Village Development:
   - Natural, organic growth
   - Realistic population scaling (e.g., 3 villagers = cottage phase)
   - Dynamic role evolution based on village size
   - Collaborative building between player and NPCs
   - Survival focus in early stages

4. NPC System:
   - Using DeepSeek-r1:7b for AI interactions
   - Focus on story and personality generation
   - Natural role development
   - Random events influence development
   - Organic relationship building
