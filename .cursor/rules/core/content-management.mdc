# Content Management Rules

## Rule Organization

1. File Structure:
   - All rules must be stored in `.mdc` files
   - Rules must be organized in appropriate subdirectories under `.cursor/rules`
   - Each rule file must have proper YAML frontmatter
   - Rule files must follow consistent naming conventions

2. YAML Frontmatter Requirements:
   - description: Brief explanation of the rule's purpose
   - globs: List of file patterns the rule applies to
   - version: (optional) Version number of the rule
   - dependencies: (optional) Other rules this rule depends on

3. Content Preservation:
   - Never delete existing rules without explicit confirmation
   - Preserve historical context and lessons learned
   - Keep track of rule modifications with timestamps
   - Archive outdated rules instead of deleting them
   - Mark rules as deprecated rather than removing them

4. Context-Based Organization:
   - Rules are organized into specific contexts for better accessibility
   - Each context represents a different aspect of the project
   - Contexts can be activated or deactivated based on current task
   - Multiple contexts can be active simultaneously
   - New contexts can be created as needed

5. Available Contexts:
   - Core Rules: Fundamental guidelines and principles
   - Project Status: Current state and progress
   - Development Stack: Technical requirements and versions
   - Architecture: System design and patterns
   - Testing: Quality assurance and validation
   - UI/UX: Interface and user experience
   - Performance: Optimization and efficiency
   - Documentation: Code and project documentation
   - Deployment: Release and distribution
   - Maintenance: Updates and bug fixes

6. Context Management:
   - Review active contexts at the start of each task
   - Load only relevant contexts for current work
   - Update context status when switching tasks
   - Document context dependencies
   - Track context-specific progress

7. Rule Modification Process:
   - Document the reason for changes
   - Update timestamp in frontmatter
   - Update all affected files
   - Notify relevant team members
   - Update documentation as needed

8. Documentation Standards:
   - Use clear, concise language
   - Include examples where appropriate
   - Keep formatting consistent
   - Use proper markdown syntax
   - Include links to related rules
   - Maintain table of contents
