  - Generic type constraints
  - Event-driven architecture
  - Plugin system foundation
  - Uniform interfaces

## Implementation Progress

1. Core Module Updates
   [X] Create abstract base classes
     - IResource
     - ITask
     - IWeather
     - ITimeManager
     - IGameState
   
   [X] Implement event system
     - EventBus
     - Event types
     - Observer pattern
     - Event handlers

   [X] Design plugin architecture
     - Plugin registry
     - Plugin loader
     - Extension points
     - Plugin interfaces

2. Resource System Enhancements
   [X] Resource transformation pipeline
   [X] Quality propagation system
   [X] Resource combination rules
   [X] Storage management
   [X] Resource events

3. Task System Improvements
   [X] Task composition system
   [X] Prerequisite chain handling
   [X] Task modification system
   [X] Task event propagation
   [X] Task result handling

4. Integration Updates
   [X] Weather effects system
   [X] Time influence system
   [X] Location management
   [X] State persistence
   [X] Cross-system events

## Next Steps
1. [X] Update resource_manager.py to use new abstractions
2. [X] Update task.py to use new abstractions
3. [X] Update weather_manager.py to use new abstractions
4. [X] Add tests for core abstractions
5. [X] Add tests for modifier system
6. [X] Add tests for resource system
7. [X] Add tests for task system
8. [ ] Add tests for weather system
9. [ ] Add integration tests

## Known Issues
1. Performance optimization needed for large resource collections
2. Weather transition smoothing needs improvement
3. Task chain visualization pending
4. Resource decay rate tuning required
5. Plugin hot-reload system incomplete
