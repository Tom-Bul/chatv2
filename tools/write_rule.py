        content="""# Architecture Principles

## Core Philosophy

Design for Maximum Modularity and Interconnection:
- Every system should be able to interact with other systems
- Use interfaces and abstract classes for flexibility
- Avoid hard-coded relationships between components
- Design systems to be extensible without modifying existing code
- Use event systems for inter-component communication

## Design Principles

1. Component Design:
   - Make components composable and reusable
   - Implement generic type parameters where beneficial
   - Use dependency injection for loose coupling
   - Design data structures that can be easily extended
   - Create flexible serialization systems

2. System Architecture:
   - Allow for dynamic loading of new content
   - Support modding through plugin architecture
   - Use observer pattern for system interactions
   - Implement component-based architecture
   - Design for emergent gameplay

3. State Management:
   - Make systems stateless where possible
   - Use strategy pattern for interchangeable behaviors
   - Support runtime configuration of relationships
   - Design for testability and simulation
   - Create uniform interfaces for similar concepts

## System Interactions

Examples:
- Resources should work with any crafting system
- Weather should affect all outdoor activities
- Skills should be applicable to multiple task types
- Tools should be usable in creative ways
- Buildings should interact with multiple systems
- NPCs should respond to any event type
- Seasons should affect all relevant systems
- Quality should propagate through transformations
- Time should influence all appropriate systems
- Location should matter for all activities

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Code Organization:
   - Use abstract base classes for core concepts
   - Implement generic type constraints
   - Design flexible data structures
   - Create uniform interfaces
   - Use event-driven architecture

2. Design Patterns:
   - Implement visitor pattern for interactions
   - Design plugin system for extensions
   - Use factory pattern for object creation
   - Implement command pattern for actions
   - Create decorator pattern for modifications

3. Best Practices:
   - Follow SOLID principles
   - Use dependency injection
   - Implement event-driven design
   - Create clear interfaces
   - Support extensibility"""
